3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?

    In a main file(for example, app.js) put `require('dotenv').config();` at the top.
    Create a variable(s) defined in an .env file.
    Use `process.env` to access all the sensitive information saved in the .env file

    Add .env file to .gitignore file.
    It prevents all the sensitive information from .env file to be loaded to Git Hub
